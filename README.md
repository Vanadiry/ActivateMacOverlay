# ActivateMacOverlay
Ever wanted to pirate macOS, but never had the chance because every Mac you buy already comes with macOS built-in? Now you can experience the thrill of downloading a macOS ISO from the internet and using it without activating.

## What it does?
Causes a pop-up message to remain in the lower right corner of your screen while the application is running.

## Custom label
You don't necessarily have to leave it as "macOS", you can put whatever you want. Even "TempleOS".
